          <p>After what felt like an endless journey filled with rejection, self-doubt, and quiet tears—I finally did it. I got placed.</p>

          <p>I received my offer letter on <strong>27th July</strong>, and even now, a week later, I still can’t fully describe the feeling. There was no grand celebration—just a deep, quiet sigh of relief. My parents were genuinely happy, and that happiness reflected something I had craved for so long: peace.</p>

          <p>Even more surprising? It’s a <strong>work-from-home</strong> opportunity at a company called <strong>Audentes Tech</strong>. I never expected things to work out this way, especially after over a year of non-stop applications, unpaid internships, and emotional setbacks. But life surprised me—just when I had stopped expecting anything.</p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The Unexpected Domain</h2>
          <p>The domain I landed in is completely new to me—<strong>Salesforce</strong>. I had zero knowledge about it, having invested most of my learning energy into <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. But that’s what I’ve learned recently: life doesn’t follow your plans. It unfolds its own map and asks you to trust the process.</p>

          <p>The first week was smooth. The people are supportive, and the learning curve, though steep, excites me. I'm not sure where this road leads—but for the first time in months, I’m okay with that uncertainty.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Lessons from the Void</h2>
          <p>After more than a hundred rejections, I started questioning everything—my skills, my path, my decisions. I accepted unpaid internships. I explored domains far from my comfort zone. I learned that life doesn’t always reward effort immediately—and sometimes, it doesn’t reward it at all. But that doesn’t mean it’s not worth it.</p>

          <p>During this time, I also saw how people change. Some close ones I expected empathy from simply vanished. To them, I was just a failure. But I carry no anger—only understanding. Everyone's busy writing their own stories. I just needed to keep writing mine.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Destiny is Weirdly Beautiful</h2>
          <p>What is truly meant for you will arrive—maybe not in the shape or time you imagined, but it will. My story isn’t extraordinary, but it’s honest. And perhaps that’s enough to inspire someone who’s still waiting for their moment.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">💬 To Anyone Who Feels Left Behind:</h2>
          <p>Don’t tie yourself to just one path. Be open to detours. Be open to learning something new—even if it wasn’t in your original plan. You don’t need a happy ending to be proud of your story. Sometimes, a happy start is all you need.</p>
          <p>This is mine. Finally.</p>
