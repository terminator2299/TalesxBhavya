          <p>It‚Äôs been almost a month since I started my first job, and honestly, the journey has been more meaningful than I imagined. Not because of grand achievements or major milestones‚Äîbut because of the quiet, steady growth and the incredible people I‚Äôve had the chance to work with.</p>

          <p>Starting out, I didn‚Äôt know much about <strong>Salesforce</strong>. It was an entirely new domain for me. I had spent most of my college time exploring Machine Learning, so this shift felt sudden‚Äîand a little scary. But life doesn‚Äôt always stick to our plans. Sometimes, it nudges us gently (or not so gently) into something completely unexpected.</p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The People Made It Easier</h2>
          <p>What truly helped me settle in was the team. From day one, they treated me with kindness and patience. They didn‚Äôt make me feel like I was behind or out of place. Instead, they guided me, taught me like a junior, and never made me feel small for not knowing things. That support gave me the space to learn, make mistakes, and grow without fear.</p>

          <p>It reminded me how much of a difference the right people can make. The environment didn‚Äôt feel competitive or cold‚Äîit felt like a place where I could breathe, ask questions, and take my time.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Learning Salesforce</h2>
          <p>To my surprise, I actually started enjoying Salesforce. The topics weren‚Äôt as intimidating as I first assumed. I got to work on <strong>Apex classes</strong>, <strong>triggers</strong>, <strong>Lightning Web Components</strong>, and <strong>test classes</strong>. Bit by bit, I completed assignments, asked for feedback, and slowly built my confidence.</p>

          <p>I know there‚Äôs still so much more to learn‚Äîbut I‚Äôve got the basics down now. And that gives me the energy to keep moving forward. This domain isn‚Äôt just for experts. If you‚Äôre curious and consistent, you‚Äôll find your way through.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">A Spark to Keep Going</h2>
          <p>I‚Äôve realized that I have a real zeal to keep learning. I want to grow‚Äînot just technically, but as someone who can think, solve problems, and bring value to whatever team I‚Äôm part of. I don‚Äôt want to stop at "good enough." I want to become someone my future self would be proud of.</p>

          <p>Every opportunity teaches you something. And if you listen closely, it opens the door to many more. That‚Äôs what this job has done for me. It reminded me that the journey doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect to be worth it.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">üí¨ A Note to Fellow Learners:</h2>
          <p>If you're just starting out, don't worry about being perfect. You don‚Äôt need to know everything before taking your first step. You just need to stay open, stay curious, and show up every day with a willingness to grow.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôm still learning. And honestly, I hope I never stop.</p>
