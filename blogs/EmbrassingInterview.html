          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">1. The Interview Blow</h2>
          <p>
            Yesterday, I faced one of the most embarrassing moments in a tech interview. The interviewer opened my GitHub and gave me a blunt observation:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-400 italic text-gray-700 bg-white p-3 rounded mt-2">
            🗣 "Lagta hai tum kam code karte ho"
          </blockquote>
          <p class="mt-2">
            I looked at my profile later — only 55 contributions this year 😭. It hit me hard. It didn’t matter how many hours I spent learning, building privately, or experimenting. What mattered was what was visible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">2. Freezing on the Spot</h2>
          <p>
            After the GitHub moment, he asked a basic question — to name some LLM models. I’ve studied this stuff. Worked on it. Yet in that very moment, I froze.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
            🗣 "I'm not able to recall" 😭
          </p>
          <p>
            I knew the answers — GPT, BERT, LLaMA, Mistral — but my mind was blank. Anxiety took over, and the silence in the room felt louder than anything.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">3. The Downward Spiral</h2>
          <p>
            As soon as the interview ended, I started spiraling. I kept thinking about everything I did wrong. 
            My aura was turning completely negative 🫠. I felt like saying:
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-orange-600">"Khatam, tata, bye bye."</p>
          <p>
            It felt like I wasn't cut out for this — that maybe I'm not good enough despite the efforts.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">4. What the Graph Doesn’t Show</h2>
          <p>
            The GitHub graph doesn’t show the nights I stayed awake debugging models, the private repositories I’ve built, or the Udemy courses I’ve completed. It doesn’t reflect growth — it reflects visibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s when I realized I need to show up more — not just learn in the shadows.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">5. Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>
            This experience was tough, but it was a needed wake-up call. Here’s what I’m doing next:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5">
            <li>Push even small code updates to GitHub consistently</li>
            <li>Keep my learning public through projects and blogs</li>
            <li>Be prepared for fundamental questions</li>
            <li>Keep my mental calm even during tough interviews</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-2">
            I know now that perception matters. What people can see often weighs more than what they can't.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">6. The Mindset Shift</h2>
          <p>
            I may have fumbled in that interview, but I won’t let that define my journey. Every rejection, every awkward moment, every forgotten answer — it all adds up to a comeback story.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still learning, still growing, and still here — more committed than ever.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold mt-2">
            The grind continues. <br />
            The spark isn't gone — it's just being re-lit 🔥.
